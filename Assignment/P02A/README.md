#Program 2A - Ncurses test
##Rohan Gajmer
###Description
This program is a simple "Hello, World!" application written in C++ using the ncurses library. It serves as a test to verify that the ncurses library is correctly installed and functioning on Windows 11 using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). The program demonstrates basic usage of ncurses functions such as initializing the library, printing text to the screen, and handling user input.

- To get a shot at full credit (100), you do the following:
  - Create a wiki for your `OOP primer`.
  - Each definition will be a page in your wiki to include images and especially code examples when appropriate.
  - Wikis are automatically a part of every repo and use the same markdown to create pages in them.
  - They simply add the ability to add additional organizing features (headers, footers, sidebar menus,etc.)
  - You can even turn your a repo or wiki into a website using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (not necessary for assignment).
